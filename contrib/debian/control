 technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions
 and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. BitenX Core
 is the name of the open source software which enables the use of this currency.
 .
 This package provides the daemon, bitenxd, and the CLI tool
 bitenx-cli to interact with the daemon.

Description: peer-to-peer digital currency - standalone transaction tool
 BitenX is an experimental new digital currency that enables anonymous, instant

 technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions
 and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. BitenX Core
 is the name of the open source software which enables the use of this currency.

 This package provides bitenx-tx, a command-line transaction creation
 tool which can be used without a bitenx daemon.  Some means of
 exchanging minimal transaction data with peers is still required.
